## Weather App Project page

**Project description:** As a scratch on a personal itch this app was developed to prepare reports on local weather condition. Many times I have found myself trapped in a rain when commuting for work. I would sure be nice to have an educated guess in advance about the weather conditions in the next few hours. The app uses weather api calls to collect temporal weather data. 
### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
